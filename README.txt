Programming Assignment 3 (G3)

I believe I have completed all required parts of this assignment.

Commands

Build the project: make
Clean the project: make clean
Run test case (GAMES=4 DIMENSION=8): make test
Run with custom parameters: GAMES=(# of games) DIMENSION=(# of rows/columns) make run

I also included a few screenshots with me running additional tests with the code.
